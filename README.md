# MilkerTools

## <em>Tools for milking from the teets of the interwebs</em>

MilkerTools is a suite of things and bobbers I am developing with a childish notion of the process below being true:

1. Create a crypto trading bot
2. Slap some forecasting model on it
3. ???
4. Profit

I've chosen Bitstamp as the exchange to use because it was the first one I found that is regulated in EU and has a decent REST API that is accessible to private individuals.

#### Current stage of development

- [x] Rudimentary Bitstamp API wrapper class
- [x] Relevant models corresponding with the Bitstamp API
- [x] Methods for logging market data to InfluxDB
- [ ] Foundations for the trading bot: A console app
- [ ] Slap some TSF model on the bot
- [ ] Writing some tests for testing how well the bot forecasts
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Throw some money on it and see what happens
